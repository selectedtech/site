SelectedTech is a group of four MVPs doing webinars and sessions on SharePoint, Office365 and the Microsoft AI ecosystem. Learn, Share, Reuse. We are Albert-Jan Schot, Rick Van Rousselt, Stephan Bisser and Thomy GÃ¶lles.

We decided to work together as a group to release webinar like videos. What we want to show is how we do stuff. We meet online and hit the record button. There is not a lot of time for preparation or planning for our webinars. As a result, you will see mistakes and errors, not high polished content. We strongly believe that showing how to overcome those hiccups adds additional value to the content.
