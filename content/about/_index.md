SelectedTech is a group of four MVPs doing webinars and sessions on SharePoint, Office365 and the Microsoft AI ecosystem. Learn, Share, Reuse. We are Albert-Jan Schot, Rick Van Rousselt, Stephan Bisser and Thomy Gölles.

We decided to work together as a group to release webinar like videos. What we want to show is how we build our demo's in the community. We meet online and hit the record button. There is not a lot of time for preparation or planning for our webinars. As a result, you will see mistakes and errors, not high polished content.  We strongly believe that showing how to overcome those hiccups adds additional value to the content. If you ever want to provide input on a topic just reach out on Twitter and well make sure to get it in!
