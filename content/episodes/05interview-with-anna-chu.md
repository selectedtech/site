The SelectedTech Webinar 005 is a special episode. We got a chance to catch up with [Anna Chu](https://twitter.com/_achu) from Microsoft. We talked about the upcoming [Ignite conference](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite) and why you should be in Orlando in November.

At Ignite you learn innovative ways to build solutions and migrate and manage your infrastructure. Connect with over 25,000 individuals focused on software development, security, architecture, and IT. Explore new hands-on experiences that will help you innovate in areas such as security, cloud, and hybrid infrastructure and development.

Interesting for us was that Anna right in the beginning of the interview made a statement that this year the developer community is back in the focus of the Ignite program team. Over the last couple of years, it seemed like Ignite was more an IT Pro targeted kind of event. Looking forward to seeing more dev content on the agenda.

Anna is the Community Lead for Ignite and Ignite The Tour at Microsoft. If you need guidance or a few hints on how to submit content for Ignite this year, you may find some insights between the lines in the interview as well.
