In Episode 20 we have a guest: [Rutger Knijnenburg](https://twitter.com/knijnops). We talk about building AI models in the Cloud and running them locally. Rutger and Albert-Jan show how to run models using Docker and keep all your data locally. In the case they show how to enrich your on-premises SharePoint data with a local LUIS model.
