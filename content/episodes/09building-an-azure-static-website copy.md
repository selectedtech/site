Episode 9 is all about using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Azure Static websites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website). Appie walks us through how he used Hugo for his blog and how we use it here for serving this website. Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. Itâ€™s written in Go (aka Golang) and developed by [bep](https://github.com/bep), [spf13](https://github.com/spf13) and [friends](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/graphs/contributors). We talk about how Hugo is used to build a static website on your local machine and how to test it during the content creation process. The source of the site is then committed to a Github repository. From there Azure Pipelines take over to publish the generated HTML file to an Azure Static website, et voila, new content is published on our page.
