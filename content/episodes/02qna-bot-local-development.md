The SelectedTech Webinar 002 about local QnA bot development and deployment to Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Teams is now available. We recorded the session on July 4th 2019. Check it out and leave a comment or send a tweet or message if you have any questions.

In this episode we take the QnA bot from webinar 001 and download the code to a local machine. After showing how to run the bot in a local IIS we use ngrok for tunneling access for a Teams deployment. After making a minor code change we republish the bot and make sure everything is still working. The episode ends with Rick asking Stephan about using Azure DevOps for CI/CD which will be our topic for Webinar 003.
