In episode 35 Stephan walks us through the use of Team Task Modules in the Bot Composer. Task modules allow you to create a pop-up experience in Teams. Either to gather additional info or to show additional info. Combined with the Bot Composer you can gather input for your chatbot experience without flooding a channel with info. Stephan shows all steps required; from installing the packages to creating the triggers and handle the responses ✔️.
