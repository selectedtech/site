As we are running our Selected Tech site as a static site on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) we spend an episode looking on how to tweak performance. Appie shows us on how to use [Google Pagespeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) to tweak the Hugo output and maximize the performance score of a site. Including tips & tricks and of course the best practices applied to our blogs and selected tech site.
