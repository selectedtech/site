The Bot Framework Composer is a new tool from Microsoft helping developers in creating bots with the help of a graphical interface. Its goal is to allow multi-disciplinary teams to build bots and conversational experiences with the Microsoft Bot Framework. The tool is currently available in preview but we already showed it at our ESPC workshop and a couple of other events. The feedback was quite good so we thought it would be a good idea to introduce the tool to a broader audience as well. So tune in to see us creating a Chuck Norris joke bot within minutes.

If you want to stay up to date with what is going on with the Microsoft Bot Framework make sure to follow [Ben Brown](https://twitter.com/benbrown) and [Gary Pretty](https://twitter.com/GaryPretty) from the actual engineering team on Twitter.
