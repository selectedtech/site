The SelectedTech Webinar 003 about using CI/CD with your bot and Azure DevOps is now available. We recorded the session on July 4th 2019. Check it out and leave a comment or send a tweet or message if you have any questions.

In this episode Stephan demos how to create a build and release pipeline within Azure DevOps. We discuss the two different configurations for build and release and talk about how to reuse your config for different target systems. The goal is to switch your target environment with Azure DevOps and to be able to deploy your bot to different Azure tenants just by clicking through the release pipeline.
