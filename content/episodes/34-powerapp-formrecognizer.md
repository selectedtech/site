In episode 34 we see Rick presenting Power Apps ðŸ”¥. Based on a real life use case from his wife he build a Power App for the Iphone to scan images and have Azure Form Recognizer process them. The result is extracted content from images that can then be used to compare. The ultimate goal to quickly build a sample that would help his wife identify configuration settings based on printed paper is a great sample on how a quick app can save you time!
